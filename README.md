# crawler-collage
A collage-making web crawler

This is a web crawler that starts at a url given by the user
and takes all of the images from that page. Then, the crawler
visits every link on that page and collects all of those images.
This continues until the page limit is reached or a complete dead-end
is hit.

Finally, a collage is made with all of the images found.
